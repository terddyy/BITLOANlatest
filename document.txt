BitLoan – AI-Powered BTC Collateral Protection

Problem
BTC-backed loans are risky:


Sudden price crashes trigger instant liquidations


Users lose BTC at the worst time


Result: panic, churn, and distrust in DeFi lending



MVP Solution
AI-Powered Price Drop Protection
AI Forecast (off-chain, lightweight)


Uses Prophet to detect sudden BTC dips


Data sources: Chainlink, Binance API


User Alerts


In-app + SMS 


Instant Top-Up


Pre-approved linked wallet adds collateral automatically


Or manual 1-tap confirmation


✅ Prevents liquidation, protects BTC holdings
 ✅ Deployable in weeks, low cost

User Story (Simple Scenario)
Without Top-Up:
BTC $30k → 0.5 BTC = $15k


Drops 20% → $12k → collateral ratio = 120% → liquidated → user loses BTC


With Top-Up:
AI predicts dip → warns user


Auto-adds $3k USDT from linked wallet → ratio back to 150%


BTC rebounds → user survives, keeps BTC



MVP Trade-Offs
Pros: fast to build, low-cost, user protection


Cons: not 100% accurate, off-chain adds centralization


Upgrade path: add on-chain flows, sentiment data, advanced ML

Retail traders who want to survive volatility
